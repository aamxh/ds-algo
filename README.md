## Algorithms and Data Structures
This repository contains common algorithms and data structures programs implemented in Java. It is made for personal learning purpose and for anyone who finds it beneficial.

### Algorithms implemented
* Binary Search within arrays:
  * Run-time complexity: O(log(n)).
* Bubble Sort within arrays:
  * Run-time complexity: O(n^2).
  * Space complexity: O(1).
* Selection Sort within arrays:
  * Run-time complexity: O(n^2).
  * Space complexity: O(1).
* Insertion Sort within arrays:
  * Run-time complexity: O(n^2).
  * Space complexity: O(1).
* Merge Sort within arrays:
  * Run-time complexity: O(n.log(n)).
  * Space complexity: O(n).
* Quick Sort within arrays:
  * Run-time complexity: O(n.log(n)) -> O(n^2).
  * Space complexity: O(log(n)).
### Data Structures implemented:
None yet :/
